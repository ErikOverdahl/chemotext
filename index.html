			Chemotext is a publicly-available Webserver that mines the published literature
			in PubMed in the form of 
			<a href="https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/search" target="_blank">
				Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms.
			</a>
		</p>
		
		<p>The goal of Chemotext is to enable text-based drug-target-disease relationships 
		in order to identify novel drug repurposing candidates and discovery targets.</p>
		
		<p>Text-based relationships have been created between each MeSH term and every article 
		in which the term is referenced.</p>
		
		<p>Through text-mining the published literature, 
		complex connections between MeSH terms in various articles can be made.</p>

			<p><br>There are over 15,000 MeSH Terms, 240,000 Supplementary Records, 19 Million Articles, and 78 Million Relationships 
	in the Chemotext Neo4j Database. Major MeSH updates are released by the National Library of Medicine by the start of every calendar year. The last major Chemotext database update was on June 19, 2017.<p>
